Code for blogpost "Adjectives Can Reveal Gender Biases Within NLP Models"

To improve the speeds at which the code runs, it has been parallelized such that it prompts the OpenAI API with multiple files at a time rather than one after the other.
To run the code, press the "Run Python File" button or put "python main.py" in the terminal.
